# Guessing-Game
Hello! 
This is one of my first projects and I'm really looking forward to feedback and tips that could improve my code in the future.
So this is a console game where you have to answer questions.
But now let's talk about how the game is played. So first you'll have to type a command for something to happen. If you want to start a game type: /StartGame and if you want to see all the commands type: /ListCommands. After starting a game you'll be asked to select a level. There are 3 level but by default you'll have access to only the 1st level. So if you want to get access to the other levels you'll need to beat the current highest level (in total there are 3 levels). 
Hope you enjoy the game and leave reveal on the code (also I know some of the questions are kinda stupid but the questions weren't my biggest priority).
